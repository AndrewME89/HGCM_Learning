                          <li>Check that the Sharing Guest has been added into the “Guests” tab.</li></p>
                          <li>Check that the Pre-Auth ID has been entered in the “Communications” tab, and update any other notes in the Remarks section, such as if the bond is being covered by another room, etc.</li></p>
                          <li>Once all of these things have been updated, initial the CARD and UPD section on the bottom right of the Guest Registration Card and file it in the correct box under the bench on the right.</li></p>
